# Purpose: To first decompress JoJo's Colored Adventures into /tmp as images, to then create a readable PDF out of the pictures.

# It takes 2 input parameters, the archive to work on, and the output dir, if none is specified, the working dir is assumed:
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
	echo "No arguments supplied"
	echo "Usage:"
	echo "jojo-pdf-stitcher [input-archive] [OPTIONAL: output-directory]"
	echo -e "\nExample: jojo-pdf-stitcher ./"Volume 1 - Dio the Invader.rar" ./stitched-pdfs"
	echo -e "Will produce a stitched PDF from the Volume 1 archive, and put it into the stitched-pdfs directory."
	echo -e "\nNB: If no output directory is specified, the output will go to the current working directory."
	exit 1
fi

# Treat the input parameters:
input=$1
filename=$(basename -- "$input")
extension="${filename##*.}"
filenoext="${filename%.*}"

# Either there is a second parameter for output directory or not:
if [ -z "$2" ]; then
	outputdir=$(pwd)
else
	outputdir=$2
fi

# The file extension switches between decompression utilities.
# Will decompress the specified file to /tmp to begin the stitching in RAM:
if [ $extension == "rar" ]; then
	echo "Received a .$extension file"
	unrar x "$input" /tmp
elif [ $extension == "zip" ]; then
	echo "Received a .$extension file"
	unzip "$input" -d /tmp
else
	echo "Unrecognized archive format, exiting..."
	exit 1
fi

# Create a page list using ls,
# Grep for making sure only image files are allowed through:
ls -dw1 "/tmp/$filenoext"/* | grep -E "\.*(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|tiff)$" > /tmp/page-list

# Add " to beginning and end of every line of the page-list, to account for spaces in file names:
sed "s/.*/\"&\"/" /tmp/page-list > /tmp/page-list-string

# Using page-list, convert the decompressed files into a cohesive PDF:
convert -quality 50 @/tmp/page-list-string "$outputdir/$filenoext.pdf"

# Removes the files from /tmp:
rm -rf "/tmp/$filenoext" /tmp/page-list /tmp/page-list-string
